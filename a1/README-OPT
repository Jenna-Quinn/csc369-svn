To improve `mymalloc` efficiency, I did the following:

- Avoid zeroing-out allocated memory by removing the call to `memset`.
- Return early from the first-fit loop to prevent iterating over the entire block list every time.
- Continue to use the first-fit strategy since it is faster than best-fit, but uses more space.
- Continue to coalesce adjacent free blocks to use memory more effectively
